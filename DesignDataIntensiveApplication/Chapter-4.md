# Encoding and Evolution
A few factors to considerï¼š
* Backward compability: new code reads old data
* Forward compability: old code reads new data
* Language free: some encoded data are limited to some languages only. But as transfer layer, it needs to be able to be decoded by different languages.
* Versioning of the data: the encoder/decoder needs to pick the right schema version.
* Efficiency: CPU time taken to encode or decode and the size of encoded data.
